# Heart Failure Analysis & Prediction
Project includes the preliminary analysis and machine learning classifier model for the Heart Failure dataset. Clinical records come from the kaggle collection. The dataset contains columns such as:

* **Age**,
* **Anaemia** - decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin,
* **Creatinine phosphokinase** - level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L),
* **Diabetes** - if the patient has diabetes,
* **Ejection Fraction** - percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction,
* **High blood pressure** - if the patient has hypertension,
* **Platelets** - platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL),
* **Serum creatinine** - level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL),
* **Serum sodium** - level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L),
* **Sex** - woman or men,
* **Smoking** - if the patient smokes or not,
* **Time** - follow-up period (days),
* **Death Event** - if the patient deceased during the follow-up period.

All features are described on the kaggle page. You can find there everything about this data set. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data)
